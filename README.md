# object-oriented-programming_cpp
This repository houses a collection of object-oriented programs written in C++. The main project, a culmination of the "Object-oriented Programming and C++" class during my second year of studies, is a comprehensive undertaking showcasing key principles of object-oriented design and programming.

# FINAL TASK: doKTOr1 - Short Version

## Introduction
Design and implement the board game "DoKTOr" in C++. Read the full details in Polish in `final_project/FINAL_PROJECT.md`.

## Game Description
Players move on a linear board, starting from a start field and aiming to reach the end field. Movement is determined by rolling a die.

## Board
A looped board with various field types: start, end, empty, regeneration, jump, and wait.

The game begins with the 9th doKTOr, undergoing regeneration on specific fields.

## Dice
Three dice: common, defective, and deteriorating. Players choose a die before each roll.

## Players
Computer players with different strategies: random, traditional, experimenting, and wary.

## Ending the Game
The 13th doKTOr reaching the end field wins. The game continues until the end of the winning round.

## Program
Write a C++ program simulating the game based on data from a text file.

## Data Format
The file includes player and field descriptions.
